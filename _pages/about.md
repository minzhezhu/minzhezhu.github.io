Hi! I am a Ph. D. student in [School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/). My advisor is [Prof. Meng Chen](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/chenmeng/zh_CN/index.htm).

My research interest lies in Biratioanl Algebraic Geometry, especially Higher Dimensional Boundedness Theory. Recently, I work on Boundedness of klt stable minimal models. I also work on explicit birational geometry, for example, calculating explicit effective birationality and lower bound of volumes of epsilon-lc polarized surfaces and threefolds. If you also have interest in these topics, please kindly contact me by e-mail.
