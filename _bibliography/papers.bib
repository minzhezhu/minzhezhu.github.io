  title={Boundedness of stable minimal models with klt singularities},
  author={Minzhe Zhu},
  abstract={We investigate the singularities and boundedness of a special kind of algebraic varieties so-called stable minimal models, which are constructed and studied by Birkar. Given a klt stable minimal model with bounded relative volume, if we fix the dimension, Iitaka volume, and a DCC set controlling coefficients, then we show that the singularities of the klt stable minimal model can be controlled uniformly. Furthermore, we prove that with certain bounded data, stable minimal models with klt singularities form a bounded family.},

      abstract={In this paper, we investigate the explicit birational geometry for projective ϵ-lc varieties polarised by nef and big Weil divisors. We show that if X is a projective ϵ-lc variety, H is a nef and big Weil divisor with dim\phi_{H}(X)≥n−1 and L is an effective Weil divisor such that |L−KX|≠∅ or L−KX is nef, then we can find an explicit lower bound of vol(H) and prove that |L+m′H| is birational for m′≥m, where m is an explicit number which depends only on n and ϵ. This result can be applied to polarised Calabi-Yau varieties, Fano varieties and varieties of general type.},
